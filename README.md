# fast-mermaid
Live Mermaid editor using FastHTML

## Creating Mermaid Graphs

You can either upload a Mermaid file, or type directly into the text area.
Both interactions will create an SVG using the Mermaid Ink API, and display it in the content area.

## Notes 

I included a sample file "editor_workflow.mermaid" that shows the workflow of this app itself. You can upload it to see the graph!
